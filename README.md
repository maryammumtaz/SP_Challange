#CHALANGES FACED
I am quite a good developer in REACT MUI and REACT NATIVE because I have gone through extensive experience of this engine over the past 2 and Half years. But honestly speaking i faced issues by selecting a package supprting dragging and reorder because i haven't use anything like this before. After research thanks to REACT_DRAG_REORDER package found to be good enough to solve my requirements.
